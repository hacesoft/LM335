## Required Tools:
- Wire cutters
- Crimping pliers for ferrules
- Wire stripping pliers
- Soldering iron
- Heat gun

## Required Materials:
- **LM335Z/NOPB** ([link](https://www.gme.cz/v/1490445/texas-instruments-lm335z-nopb-analogovy-teplotni-sensor)), datasheet: [here](https://img.gme.cz/files/eshop_data/eshop_data/4/530-003/dsh.530-003.1.pdf)
- **Crimp ferrules** (use the extended ones!)
- **Twin-core wire** (used red/black, 0.35mmÂ²)
- **Heat shrink tubing**
  - 4.8/2.4 mm for soldered joints
  - 8.4/4.8 mm for LM335Z/NOPB itself

## Assembly Instructions:

1. Cut the cables to the required length and strip the ends by a few cm. I used about 1.2 meters.
2. Solder the **negative PIN (-)** to the black wire with heat shrink tubing.
3. Solder the **positive PIN (+)** to the red wire with heat shrink tubing.
4. **ADJ PIN remains unconnected.**
5. Slide the **8.4/4.8 mm heat shrink tubing** over the LM335Z/NOPB and use a heat gun until it shrinks. No adhesive is needed.
6. On the other end, **crimp extended ferrules** onto the cables (short ones will not hold in the connector!).
7. **Remove the middle connector from Cerbo!**

8. The **pin closest to the case is GND** - insert the **black wire** there, then the **red wire** above it.
9. [Watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvLgENfeDKw&ab_channel=Holomint) for reference.

## Cerbo Configuration:
- Enable the required number of sensors. I made 4 sensors and used them to measure the **temperature of the inverters**.

- It's a good idea to **name them properly**, such as **Inverter L1, Inverter L2, Inverter L3, and Rack Temperature.**

## VRM Monitoring:
- You will see the sensors in VRM like this:

- And detailed temperature statistics:

- The devices list will look like this:

**Work carefully and always double-check before making any modifications!**
